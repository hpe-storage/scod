### HPE 3PAR and Primera Container Storage Provider support
Limited to the HPE 3PAR and Primera Container Storage Provider only, best effort support is available for HPE 3PAR and HPE Primera controllers supported by the HPE 3PAR and Primera Container Storage Provider and bundled with All Inclusive software with an active HPE Pointnext support agreement. Since the HPE Pointnext support for the HPE 3PAR and Primera Container Storage Provider is best effort only, any other support levels like Warranty, Foundation Care, Proactive Care, Proactive Care Advanced and Datacenter Care or other support levels do not apply to the HPE 3PAR and Primera Container Storage Provider. Best effort response times are based on local standard business days and working hours. If your location is outside the customary service zone, response time may be longer.
