# Statement

Software components documented on SCOD are generally covered with valid support contract on the HPE product being used. Terms and conditions may be found in the support contract. Please reach out to your official HPE representative or HPE partner for any uncertainties.

## CSI Info Metrics Provider support

The HPE CSI Info Metrics Provider for Prometheus is supported by HPE when used with HPE storage arrays on valid support contracts. Send email to [support@nimblestorage.com](mailto:support@nimblestorage.com) to get started with any issue that requires assistance. Engage your HPE representative for other means to contact HPE Storage support directly.

## Container Storage Providers

Each Container Storage Provider (CSP) uses their own official support routes to resolve any issues with the HPE CSI Driver for Kuberernetes and the respective CSP.

### HPE Alletra 5000/6000 and Nimble Storage Container Storage Provider support

This software is supported by HPE when used with HPE Nimble Storage arrays on valid support contracts. Please send an email to [support@nimblestorage.com](mailto:support@nimblestorage.com) to get started with any issue you might need assistance with. Engage with your HPE representative for other means on how to get in touch with Nimble support directly.

The HPE Alletra 5000/6000 and Nimble Storage organization has made a commitment to our customers to exert reasonable effort in supporting any industry-standard configuration. We do not limit our customers to only what is explicitly listed on SPOCK or the Validated Configuration Matrix (VCM), which lists tested or verified configurations (what HPE Alletra 5000/6000 and Nimble Storage organization commonly refers to as "Qualified" Configurations). Essentially, this means that we will exert reasonable effort to support any industry-standard configuration up to the point where we find, or become aware of, an issue that requires some other course of action<sup>*</sup>.

Example cases where support may not be possible include:

- Configurations explicitly called out by SPOCK or the VCM as known not to work properly
- An OS (legacy or otherwise) that does not support or contain functionality needed by the customer
- A vendor that does not or will not support the requested functionality (either through a violation of their Best Practices or the product is End-of-Life/Support with that vendor)

<small>* = In the event where other vendors need to be consulted, the HPE Nimble Support team will not disengage from the Support Action. HPE Nimble Support will continue to partner with the customer and other vendors to search for the correct answers to the issue.</small>

### HPE Alletra 9000 and Primera and 3PAR Storage Container Storage Provider support

Limited to the HPE Alletra 9000 and Primera and 3PAR Storage Container Storage Provider (CSP) only. Best effort support is available for the CSP for HPE Alletra 9000, Primera and 3PAR Storage with All-inclusive Single or Multi-System software and an active HPE Pointnext support agreement. Since HPE Pointnext support for the CSP is best effort only, any other support levels like Warranty, Foundation Care, Proactive Care, Proactive Care Advanced and Datacenter Care or other support levels do not apply. Best effort response times are based on local standard business days and working hours. If your location is outside the customary service zone, response time may be longer.
