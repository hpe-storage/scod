# Interactive learning path
The Storage Education team at HPE has put together an interactive learning path to introduce field engineers, architects and account executives to Docker and Kubernetes. The course material has an angle to help understand the role of storage in the world of containers. It's a great starting point if you're new to containers.

Course 2-4 contains interactive labs in an immersive environment with downloadable lab guides that can be used outside of the lab environment.

It's recommended to take the courses in order.
