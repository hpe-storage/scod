&quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising 
permissions granted by this License.

&quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including 
but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and 
configuration files.

&quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or 
translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object 
code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

&quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, 
made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is 
included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix 
below).

is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, 
annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an 
original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works 
shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by 
name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original 
version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for 
inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal 
Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes 
of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or 
written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including 
but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code 
control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, 
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to 
reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or 
Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, 
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this 
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, 
and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those 
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by 
their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the 
Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent 
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a 
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of 
the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in 
Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of 
this License; and
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You 
changed the files; and
You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You 
distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the 
Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any 
part of the Derivative Works; and
If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any 
Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the 
attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices 
that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the 
following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the 
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along 
with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative 
Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents 
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that 
You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, 
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as 
modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide 
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or 
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a 
whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any 
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the 
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any 
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall 
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have 
executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, 
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required 
for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and

writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its 
Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the 
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks 
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in 
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by 
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in 
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any 
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to 
use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work 
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial 
damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the 
possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, 
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations 
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such 
obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree 
to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability 
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your 
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,

     or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
     the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

     permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

     grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

3. Responsibilities

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
     Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
        of distribution to the recipient; and

     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
        recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
     License(s).

3.4. Notices

     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
     jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
   skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
     of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
     2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an &quot;as is&quot; basis,
   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under
   this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
   not apply to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
   in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
   counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License

10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
      of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
      or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
      such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
      Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is
      Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of
      the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be
      attached.
